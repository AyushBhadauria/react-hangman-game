## Hangman Game

Create the hangman game using the following game rules:
. Play individually.
. Have the user select a letter of the alphabet.
. If the letter is contained in the word, the user takes another turn guessing a letter. To reveal a letter
(depending on which slide template is used), either:
Click on the letter in the alphabet area which will then trigger the letter to be revealed if it is
contained in the word/phrase.
Either if the letter is contained or not on the word removed from the alphabet.
. If the letter is not contained in the word, a portion of the hangman is added.
. The game continues until:
. the word is guessed (all letters are revealed) – WINNER or,
. all the parts of the hangman are displayed – LOSER
. The user has 100 seconds to place a letter
. If on that time doesn't place a new letter the game is over
. Either if the letter is contain or not in the word the timer starts again from 100
